.SH NAME
MooseFS \- networking, distributed, fault-tolerant file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
MooseFS is a networking, distributed file system. It spreads data over several
physical localisations (servers), which are visible to a user as one resource.
For standard file operations MooseFS acts as other Unix-alike file systems. It has
hierarchical structure (directory tree), stores files' attributes (permissions,
last access and modification times) as well as makes it possible to create
special files (block and character devices, pipes and sockets), symbolic links
(file names pointing to another files accessible locally, not necessarily on
MooseFS) and hard links (different names of files which refer to the same data on
MooseFS). Access to the file system can be limited basing on IP address and/or
password.

.SH ARCHITECTURE
.PP
MooseFS installation consists of four types of machines:
.IP \[bu] 2
managing/metadata servers (\fBmfsmaster\fR(8)) - small number of metadata
servers. Those servers are storing information on size, attributes and file
localisation(s), including all information about non-regular files, i.e.
directories, sockets, pipes and devices.
One of them also manages the whole filesystem. In open-source (CE) version
there can be only one mfsmaster.
.IP \[bu] 2
data servers (\fBmfschunkserver\fR(8)) - any number of commodity servers storing files
data and replicating it among themselves (if a certain file is supposed to
exist in more than one copy).
.IP \[bu] 2
metadata backup servers (\fBmfsmetalogger\fR(8)) - any number of servers, all of
which store metadata changelogs and periodically downloading base metadata file;
mainly usable as almost-ready-to-run mfsmaster in one-master installations.
it's easy to run \fBmfsmaster\fR(8) process on such machine when primary master
stops working.
.IP \[bu] 2
client computers referring to MooseFS stored files - any number of machines with
working \fBmfsmount\fR(8) process that communicates with the managing server to
receive and modify file information and with chunkservers to exchange actual
file data.
.PP
Metadata is stored in memory of the metadata servers and simultaneously is being
saved on disk (as a periodically updated binary file and immediately updated
incremental logs). The main binary file as well as the logs are replicated to
metaloggers (if present) and/or other masters (if present).
.PP
File data is divided to fragments (chunks) of maximum size 64MB each which are
stored as files on selected disks on data servers (chunkservers). Each chunk is
saved on different computers in a number of copies equal to a "goal" for the
given file.
